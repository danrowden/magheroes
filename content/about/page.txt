title: About Mag Heroes
-
content: 
_Mag Heroes_ is a new audio show that talks with people who make magazines.

Since launching [Magpile](http://magpile.com/) I've been in contact with a great group of publishers, editors and designers. I've come to realise that many of these people are hidden behind their magazines, which is something I aim to tackle with _Mag Heroes_, where I find out where they came from, how they got into magazines, and explore their day-to-day work and inspiration.

I originally planned to launch _Mag Heroes_ back in October 2012 but shelved the idea to focus on the [Magpile Store](http://magpile.com/store/). The idea never left—the mark of a good idea worth pursuing—and I finally recorded an [episode zero](/0-intro/) 13 months later.

Please get in contact—I'd love to hear from you. You can use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/magheroes) or email <dan@laiva.co>.

Happy listening!
